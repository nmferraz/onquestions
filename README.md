# OnQuestions

### Description
The objective of this site is to give the possibility to anyone to create rooms to receive questions. It is especially interesting for conferences and livestreams.

### Guide
To run this project, install the dependencies with ```yarn``` and run the project with ```yarn start```.

Remembering that you will need to create a Firebase account and a project to provide a Realtime Database.

You also need to replace the ".env.example" file with ".env.local" and put your firebase project credentials.

### The idea
This idea came together with 3 friends, so I decided to create this prototype of the idea.

### Credits
I have to give my thanks to Rocketseat, as I was inspired by one of their projects. (nlw 6)
